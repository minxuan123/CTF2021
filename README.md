This CTF Challenge is created as part of a group project for 50.042 Foundations of Cybersecurity Module (Sep 2021). You may get started with correspondance.txt

We intercepted messages between our targets, whom we believed were plotting some evil deeds against the world. It would be Christmas by the time we unwrap it ... 

The higher ups have provided us some clues on how to unravel their schemes:

1. Decoder
(Not decryption!) The real cipher has been vandalized with much rubbish words, we will have to do some cleanup first. You'll know it when you see it.

2. Add some Vinegar Cidher...
Seems like the targets are huge fans of a certain type of ciphers...sometimes they add a second layer!

3. Save our RSAsty brains~
Use the knowledge you have gained from before to crack their final line of defence!
